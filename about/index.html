<div class="about">
<p>With over five years of professional experience in information security, I began my career as an
infrastructure engineering building out the entire Atlassian for a independent consulting firm.
Since then, my hunger for knowledge has only grown. Although I began my career as an infrastructure
engineer the majority of my professional experience has been on the defensive side. Despite focusing
on blue teams professionally, I have continously studied red team tradecraft. This is evident in my continuous growth through education, certifications ( OSCE, OSCP, etc.. ), and competitions. I frequent do "capture the flag" competitions and other netowrking opportunities. Additionally, I aim to stay active in the information security network by attending national conferences such as DefCon, B-Sides, and ShmooCon.
