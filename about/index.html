<div class="about">
<p>With over five years of professional experience in information security, I began my career as an
infrastructure engineering building out the entire Atlassian for a independent consulting firm.
Since then, my hunger for knowledge has only grown. Although I began my career as an infrastructure
engineer the majority of my professional experience has been on the defensive side. Despite focusing
on blue teams professionally, I have continously studied red team tradecraft. This is evident in my continuous growth through education, certifications ( OSCE, OSCP, etc.. ), and competitions. I frequent do "capture the flag" competitions and other netowrking opportunities. Additionally, I aim to stay active in the information security network by attending national conferences such as DefCon, B-Sides, and ShmooCon.

<p>Outside of my professional life, I spend the majority of my time with my adorable (Oso Barker)[#], and his beautiful mom (my wonderful girlfriend). Oso is not only the cutest havanese you'll ever see, but also the goofiest. Evidence in his playful demeanor and constant affection (link pictures/videos)

<p>When I need a break from all the goofiness brought by Oso and my girlfriend, I have started woodworking. A chance to breakaway from the computer screen and build.
