As a system administrator, you want to create shortcut while keeping your server secure. Running in a fully Linux environment you can alias commands to make things faster and that's what this blog post is about; Creating an SSH Key, adding the ssh key into the server and adding an alias on your host to make a simple one-word shortcut to ssh into the server. SSH keys provide a more secure way of logging into a server with SSH than using just a password alone because the complexity of a password is generally not complex or long enough to be resistant to repeated, persistent attackers meaning with time can be brute forced. Generating public/private rsa ssh key pair by running - CLI: _ssh-keygen_

It will ask of you where you want to save the ssh key, it is usually _/home/**username**/.ssh/id\_rsa_ and for root _/**root**/.ssh/id\_rsa_. The private key is usually stored as id\_rsa and the associated public key will be called id\_rsa.pub. Add a passphrase for this ssh key which adds a method of securing the ssh key from being used. The easiest way to copy your public key to an existing server is to use a utility called `ssh-copy-id`. Because of its simplicity, this method is recommended if available. Copying the SSH key to Server - CLI: _ssh-copy-id root@hostname_ ![]({{ site.url }}/img/20180102/Greenshot-2018-01-02-01.28.15-300x74.png) Creating an alias is as simple as running the alias command. An example of creating the alias is _alias aliasname\='commands'._ To add an ssh alias, Adding alias to do the ssh automagically - CLI: _echo "lede='ssh root@lede'" >> ~/.bash\_profile source ~/.bash\_profile_
