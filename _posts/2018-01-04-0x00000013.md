This blog post is part two of the [Searching for your environment's Internet-connected devices](https://area1337.com/searching-for-your-environments-internet-connected-devices/) post made yesterday. It will focus on manually searching for services available on your public facing assets using open source tool [NMAP](https://nmap.org/) to gather what services are available to the public on external facing assets. Below are the ports that Censys searches for when doing global scans: TCP: 110, 143, 22, 23, 2323, 25, 30005, 443, 4443, 465, 502, 7547, 80, 8000, 8080, 993, 995, 20000 UDP: 53, 9100, 47808, 20000 If you were to convert this into it will look like this: 165.227.188.223/32, This should help with an example of where to add your subnet that intelligence should be gathered on. Magic number 32 is a single host but this can be changed to /24 or /16 depending on your network. -sT - (TCP connect scan), Add this option for more reliable by establishing a connection. It is slower because it will require a full TCP connection. -sU (UDP scans) -sV (service version detection) --script=banner (This option allows you to import a NMAP script and we will use the banner.nse script to grab detect the banners) -oA outputfile.xml; This option will save the output it in all formats. gnmap, nmap and XML.

> nmap 165.227.188.223/32 -sT -p 110,143,22,23,2323,25,30005,443,4443,465,7547,80,8000,8080,993,995 --script=banner -oA outputfile.xml
![]({{ site.url }}/img/20180104/Greenshot-2018-01-04-16.00.47-1024x606.png)

Then we will convert the XML file into an interactive HTML page for easily visible documentation using XSLTPROC.

> xsltproc nmap-output.xml -o nmap-output.html

After converting the XML file to HTML file the image below is the output.
