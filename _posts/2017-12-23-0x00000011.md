Today's blog post is sneak peek into my portable lab where most of projects sit. The management system used to manage all virtual machines locally and remotely is a 13-Inch MacBook Pro (Retina, Early 2015). This system sits on Processor: 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5, Memory: 8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3, Graphics Card: Intel Iris Graphics 6100 1536 MB running macOS. I am a huge fan of Apple MacBook but they've removed the USBs which has pushed me away from purchasing any future ones. Will be looking for a different management system soon. Current Portal Virtual Lab Hardware: [Intel NUC mini PC kit NUC7i7BNH (Intel Core i7)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N0RL8Q4) [Crucial 32GB Kit (16GBx2) DDR4 2133 MT/s (PC4-17000) DR x8 SODIMM 260-Pin](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015YPB8ME) [Samsung 960 EVO Series - 250GB PCIe NVMe - M.2 Internal SSD](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LYFKX41) [SanDisk Ultra II 250GB SATA III SSD - 2.5-Inch 7mm Height Solid State Drive](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MRD9AVT) [TP-Link AC750 Wireless Wi-Fi Travel Router (TL-WR902AC)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N5RCZQH/) The deployment runs [bare-metal hypervisor ESXi on Intel NUC](http://www.virten.net/2017/03/vmware-homeserver-esxi-on-7th-gen-intel-nuc-kaby-lake/) with a TP-Link AC750 for wireless connectivity. The TP-Link AC750 has open source project [LEDE](https://lede-project.org/toh/hwdata/tp-link/tp-link_tl-wr902ac_v1) installed. The reason for purchasing the Wi-Fi Travel router is to enable the lab to be connected to wirelessly due drivers not supported for ESXi. This deployment enables me to do so much things like assign static ip addresses to the devices connecting, set-up OpenVPN or TOR, and much more. I purchased a license of [VMware Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html) to connect to the VMware ESXi server and manage systems through there instead of web-gui.
