# Introduction to the man pages

The command line tool [man](https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/) explains and provides guidances on how to operate Unix-based systems/tools. I want to do my first blog post on the man pages because its a foundation to future blog posts. Knowing about this essential tool will equip people with a better understanding of how to find information about a specific tool and how it can be used.

# Manual sections
The manual also known as `man` is split into 8 standard sections organized by categories. These standard sections of the manual are :

+ 1 for Executable programs or shell commands
+ 2 for System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
+ 3 for Library calls (functions within program libraries)
+ 4 for Special files (usually found in /dev)
+ 5 for File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd
+ 6 for Games et. Al.
+ 7 for Miscellaneous
+ 8 for System administration commands (usually only for root)
+ 9 for Kernel routines [Non standard] (Bonus depending on distribution)

These categories will help you find the manual entry you need for the task you acquire. An on-line tool to search tools by section is [Man Sections](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/). The command line version to search by sections is `man -s <section> intro`.

# Standardized layout for the man pages

There is standardized documentation layout for the man pages. The man pages documentation are as followed :

+ NAME : *Provides the name of the command and a one line description of the tool.*
+ Synopsis : *Provides an overview on how to run the tool and what proper usage are available.*
+ Description : *Provides a textual description of the functioning of the subjected command.*
+ Options : *Gives a description of how each option affects program behaviour.*
+ Files : *List the files the program or function uses.*
+ Environment : *List all the enviroment variables that are affected by this program or function.*
+ BUGS : *In the linux world this would be considered the to do section.*
+ Author : *Self Explanitory, This gives a section for contact information.*
+ See Also : *Provides a list of related commands.*
