Working on getting around to building a Splunk Bro IDS App that populates the field to build Use cases around current deployment. In the process of building a Splunk BRO IDS app, managed to get a script together to do the fields extractions. We will call it [bro\_extractor.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felixguerrero12/area1337/master/bro_extractor.sh). This bash script is to be run inÂ /var/log/bro/current or wherever your current logs are stored. Example of output:
